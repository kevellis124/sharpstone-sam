We'll need different endpoints for different sets of data.

/users can represent the authorization and user-data services
/users/authorize
/users/{userId}
/users/getToken
/users/checkToken

/sports can be the hub for sports info

/sports/{sport}/players can represent grabbing data on which players may be inactive (injury data)
/sports/{sport}/betting can be the hub for grabbing line information
/sports/{sport}/betting/{matchupId} can grab all line info for that specific matchup
